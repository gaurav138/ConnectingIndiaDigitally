                                <p>The Indian government has undertaken a number of measures to ease access to funding for the sector.</p>

                                <p>50% of the demand for construction activity in India comes from the infrastructure sector, the rest comes from industrial activities, residential and commercial development etc. The Indian construction industry is valued at over USD 126 Billion.</p>
                                <p>Indian cities contribute significantly to India’s GDP. As per a mid-term appraisal in 2012, the urban share of the GDP was 62% – 63% in 2009-10. This was further projected to increase to 70% – 75% in 2030.</p>
                                <p>In 2001, about 286 Million were living in urban areas across India. It had the second largest urban population in the world. As per the Indian Census, 2011, the urban population had increased to 377 Million, thereby registering a growth of around 32%. As per recent estimates, nearly 590 Million people will live in Indian cities by 2030.</p>
                                <p>Between 2005-08, the real estate sector grew by about 30% annually before slowing down significantly due to a 2008 global financial crisis. It grew by about 8% between 2009-11 and 6.5% in 2012-13.</p>
                                <p>As per industry estimates, the Indian real estate market is estimated to be approximately USD 78.5 Billion in 2013 and is expected to grow to approximately USD 140 Billion by 2017.</p>
                                <p>According to FICCI-EY Real Estate Report 2013, India’s real estate requires about USD 42 Billion (excluding housing for economically weaker sections) in investments by 2015. Residential real estate alone will require an investment of USD 29 Billion.</p>

                                <p>India has an estimated urban housing shortage of 18.8 Million dwelling units. The housing shortage in rural India is estimated at 47.4 Million units, in 2012.</p>
                                <p>Present levels of urban infrastructure are inadequate to meet the demands of the existing urban population. There is need for re-generation of urban areas in existing cities and the creation of new, inclusive smart cities to meet the demands of increasing population and migration from rural to urban areas. Future cities of India will require smart real estate and urban infrastructure.</p>
                                <p>The Government of India is in the process of launching a new urban development mission. This will help develop 500 cities, which include cities with a population of more than 100,000 and some cities of religious and tourist importance. These cities will be supported and encouraged to harness private capital and expertise through PPPs, to holster their infrastructure and services in the next 10 years.</p>
                                <p>To provide quality urban services on a sustainable basis in Indian cities, the need of the hour is that urban local bodies enter into partnership agreements with foreign players, either through joint ventures, private sector partners or through other models.</p>

The mission has helped focus attention of policy makers in all three tiers of the government on the challenges facing the cities and towns of India and created dynamism in a sector that has long suffered neglect. The government of India is in the process of launching a new urban development mission. This will help develop 500 cities, which includes cities with a population of more than 100,000 and some cities of religious and tourist importance. Four fundamental activities will underpin this development. These are, the provision of safe drinking water and sewerage, use of recycled water for growing organic fruits and vegetables, solid waste management and digital connectivity.</p>
