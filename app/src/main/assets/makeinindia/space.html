A number of space science research projects in the field of atmospheric science, astronomy and planetary exploration and science payload development activities are supported and implemented at various universities and research institutes by ISRO through the recommendations of ISRO’s Advisory Committee for Space Sciences (ADCOS).</li>
                <li>Mars Orbiter Mission is ISRO’s first interplanetary mission to Mars with a spacecraft designed to orbit Mars in an elliptical orbit of 372 kms by 80,000 kms. The primary driving technological objective of the mission is to design and realise a spacecraft with a capability to reach Mars (Martian Transfer Trajectory), then to orbit around Mars (Mars Orbit Insertion) over a period of nine months.</li>
