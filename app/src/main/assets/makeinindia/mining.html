                                <p>With the Indian economy expected to grow by approximately 7% in the years to come, sectors such as infrastructure and automobiles will receive a renewed thrust, which would further generate demand for power and steel in the country. This is expected to provide a major thrust to the demand of minerals like coal and iron ore.</p>
                                <p>Minerals like manganese, lead, copper, alumina are expected to witness double digit growth in the years ahead. There is significant scope for new mining capacities in iron ore, bauxite, and coal.</p>
                                <p>India has an advantage in the cost of production and in conversion costs of steel and alumina.</p>
                                <p>Sustained growth in India’s automotive sector has been driving demand for steel and aluminium.</p>
                                <p>The power sector accounts for a large share of the consumption of aluminium and coal in the country.</p>
                                <p>Infrastructure projects continue to provide lucrative business opportunities for steel, zinc and aluminium producers.</p>
                                <p>Demand for iron and steel is set to continue, given the strong growth expectations for the residential and commercial building industry.</p>
                                <p>India has the 301.56 Billion Tonnes coal reserves as of April 2014. Production of coal stood at 540 Million Tonnes and 557.7 Million Tonnes in 2012 and 2013, respectively.</p>
                                <p>India ranks fourth globally in terms of iron ore production. In 2013, the country produced 136.02 Million Tonnes of iron ore.</p>

                                    The NMP enunciates measures like assuring rights to next stage mineral concession, transferability of mineral concessions and transparency in the allotment of concessions in order to reduce delays which are seen as impediments to investment and technology flows in the mining sector in India. The policy also seeks to develop a sustainable framework for optimum utilisation of the country’s natural mineral resources for the industrial growth in the country and at the same time improving the life of people living in the mining areas, which are generally located in the backward and tribal regions of the country.
