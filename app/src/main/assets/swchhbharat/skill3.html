At least ten million Indian youth enter the country’s workforce each year, but the employment creation in India has not been able to absorb this influx, making increasing unemployment a severe problem. Through this allocation the government aims at generating employment and providing livelihood to the millions of young Indians who enter the work force every year.</p><p>The government has invested Rs. 4000 crore in the launch of SANKALP (Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion Programme), another big initiative under the Skill India Mission. Through this it aims at providing market relevant training to 350 million young Indians. Apart from this, the government would set up 100 India International Skills Centres that will conduct advanced courses in foreign languages to help youngsters prepare for overseas jobs.</p></div>
